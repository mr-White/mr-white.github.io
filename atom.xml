        <title>Ants</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Dedicated ants on the march
Patience in their step through harsh
Weather, rain, hail, seasons pass
Smallest Species is dead last&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the dominance hierarchy
Their tunes programmed from suffering
unconscious monarchy
It’s survival, efficiently set
They made their bet
On the Queen, rarely seen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lives in a Palace, an ant pile
While the army continues single file
A line, protective order, for the chaos
Be ready to react, back flip on the event&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of relative evil, be evil
Its chaos, a rouse to fight
left, right, left, right
Ants keep marching on, unbeknownst to them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A future may be
Weak individually
Stronger as a whole
Marching forward, these little ants are so bold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holding a losing hand, yet still don’t fold
Hearts beating, life’s giving, all
These ants, we, are predators
To shield, defend, at any cost (any cost)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strength is the source
With possibilities to grow &amp;amp; shrink
Age plays a role, how cold through you
Clues observable in nature, clear truth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ants keep marching on
unconscious of the truth
Ants keep marching on (marching on)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subroutines, subconscious bubbles, seeds blossom
Growing electrical trees, frequencies
of the brain, awareness unnecessary
as ants keep marching on, through all time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the years, the fear, and tears
Ants are weird.&lt;/p&gt;
