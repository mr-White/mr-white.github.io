Patience in their step through harsh
Weather, rain, hail, seasons pass
Smallest Species is dead last&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the dominance hierarchy
Their tunes programmed from suffering
unconscious monarchy
It’s survival, efficiently set
They made their bet
On the Queen, rarely seen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lives in a Palace, an ant pile
While the army continues single file
A line, protective order, for the chaos
Be ready to react, back flip on the event&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of relative evil, be evil
Its chaos, a rouse to fight
left, right, left, right
Ants keep marching on, unbeknownst to them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A future may be
Weak individually
Stronger as a whole
Marching forward, these little ants are so bold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holding a losing hand, yet still don’t fold
Hearts beating, life’s giving, all
These ants, we, are predators
To shield, defend, at any cost (any cost)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strength is the source
With possibilities to grow &amp;amp; shrink
Age plays a role, how cold through you
Clues observable in nature, clear truth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ants keep marching on
unconscious of the truth
Ants keep marching on (marching on)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subroutines, subconscious bubbles, seeds blossom
Growing electrical trees, frequencies
of the brain, awareness unnecessary
as ants keep marching on, through all time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the years, the fear, and tears
Ants are weird.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>L</name></author><category term="BigPicture" /><category term="SeeFromTheTallestBalcony" /><summary type="html">Dedicated ants on the march Patience in their step through harsh Weather, rain, hail, seasons pass Smallest Species is dead last In the dominance hierarchy Their tunes programmed from suffering unconscious monarchy It’s survival, efficiently set They made their bet On the Queen, rarely seen Lives in a Palace, an ant pile While the army continues single file A line, protective order, for the chaos Be ready to react, back flip on the event Of relative evil, be evil Its chaos, a rouse to fight left, right, left, right Ants keep marching on, unbeknownst to them A future may be Weak individually Stronger as a whole Marching forward, these little ants are so bold Holding a losing hand, yet still don’t fold Hearts beating, life’s giving, all These ants, we, are predators To shield, defend, at any cost (any cost) Strength is the source With possibilities to grow &amp;amp; shrink Age plays a role, how cold through you Clues observable in nature, clear truth Ants keep marching on unconscious of the truth Ants keep marching on (marching on) Subroutines, subconscious bubbles, seeds blossom Growing electrical trees, frequencies of the brain, awareness unnecessary as ants keep marching on, through all time Through the years, the fear, and tears Ants are weird.</summary></entry></feed>
