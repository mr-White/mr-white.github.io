Patience in their step through harsh&lt;br /&gt;
Weather, rain, hail, seasons pass&lt;br /&gt;
Smallest Species is dead last&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the dominance hierarchy&lt;br /&gt;
Their tunes programmed from suffering&lt;br /&gt;
unconscious monarchy&lt;br /&gt;
It’s survival, efficiently set&lt;br /&gt;
They made their bet&lt;br /&gt;
On the Queen, rarely seen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lives in a Palace, an ant pile&lt;br /&gt;
While the army continues single file&lt;br /&gt;
A line, protective order, for the chaos&lt;br /&gt;
Be ready to react, back flip on the event&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of relative evil, be evil&lt;br /&gt;
Its chaos, a rouse to fight&lt;br /&gt;
left, right, left, right&lt;br /&gt;
Ants keep marching on, unbeknownst to them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A future may be&lt;br /&gt;
Weak individually&lt;br /&gt;
Stronger as a whole&lt;br /&gt;
Marching forward, these little ants are so bold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holding a losing hand, yet still don’t fold&lt;br /&gt;
Hearts beating, life’s giving, all&lt;br /&gt;
These ants, we, are predators&lt;br /&gt;
To shield, defend, at any cost (any cost)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strength is the source&lt;br /&gt;
With possibilities to grow &amp;amp; shrink&lt;br /&gt;
Age plays a role, how cold through you&lt;br /&gt;
Clues observable in nature, clear truth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ants keep marching on&lt;br /&gt;
unconscious of the truth&lt;br /&gt;
Ants keep marching on (marching on)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subroutines, subconscious bubbles, seeds blossom&lt;br /&gt;
Growing electrical trees, frequencies&lt;br /&gt;
of the brain, awareness unnecessary&lt;br /&gt;
as ants keep marching on, through all time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the years, the fear, and tears&lt;br /&gt;
How weird.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>L</name></author><category term="BigPicture" /><category term="SeeFromTheTallestBalcony" /><category term="Poetry" /><summary type="html">Dedicated ants on the march Patience in their step through harsh Weather, rain, hail, seasons pass Smallest Species is dead last In the dominance hierarchy Their tunes programmed from suffering unconscious monarchy It’s survival, efficiently set They made their bet On the Queen, rarely seen Lives in a Palace, an ant pile While the army continues single file A line, protective order, for the chaos Be ready to react, back flip on the event Of relative evil, be evil Its chaos, a rouse to fight left, right, left, right Ants keep marching on, unbeknownst to them A future may be Weak individually Stronger as a whole Marching forward, these little ants are so bold Holding a losing hand, yet still don’t fold Hearts beating, life’s giving, all These ants, we, are predators To shield, defend, at any cost (any cost) Strength is the source With possibilities to grow &amp;amp; shrink Age plays a role, how cold through you Clues observable in nature, clear truth Ants keep marching on unconscious of the truth Ants keep marching on (marching on) Subroutines, subconscious bubbles, seeds blossom Growing electrical trees, frequencies of the brain, awareness unnecessary as ants keep marching on, through all time Through the years, the fear, and tears How weird.</summary></entry></feed>
